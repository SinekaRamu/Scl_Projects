# U-turn Obstracle Detection

A U-Turn Obstacle Detection System enhances road safety by detecting obstacles in U-turn zones using sensors and alerting drivers to prevent collisions.

## System Components:

- Microcontroller – Arduino Uno for processing data.
- Ultrasonic Sensors (2) – Detect obstacles at a set distance.
- Buzzer Indicators – Alert drivers to obstacles.
- Traffic Light (2) - Traffic system.
- Bread Board - 17 pts.
- Adapter - 12 V, 1 Amps.
